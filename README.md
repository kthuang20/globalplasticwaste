# Exploratory Analysis of Global Plastic Waste Production in 2023

### *Overview*

This dataset came from
Kaggle[1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/global-plastic-waste-2023-a-country-wise-analysis/data). It
includes the following information across 165 countries in the world:

* *name of the country*
* *total plastic waste produced by country in million metric tons*
* *main sources of plastic waste of country*
* *national recycling rate of country (%)*
* *per capita waste production (kg/person)*
* *coastal waste risk assessment score*

**Important Note:** The values in this dataset are approximations based on historical trends and researched using LLM(
AI), economic indicators, and waste management patterns up to 2023.

## *Summary of Findings:*
Based on the analyses above, the following were learned about the global plastic waste production and management across 165 countries for the year 2023:
* Europe and Central Asia had the greatest per capita waste but also the highest recycling rates
* Sub-Saharn Africa had the least total plastic waste and per capita waste
* Countries with lowest coastal waste risk were associated with the least total plastic waste
* Countries with higher coastal waste risk ("High" and "Very High") had higher per capita waste
* Countries with higher total plastic waste were not associated with higher per capita waste
